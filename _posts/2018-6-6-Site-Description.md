This site is dedicated to sharing information, tutorials, or whatever comes to mind as something useful for fellow archaeologists. 

Most future posts will be focused more on the computer side of archaeology, particularly 3D Modelling, [R](https://www.r-project.org/), and GIS. 

Feedback is always welcome. Leave a comment on a blog or email me at bischrob@gmail.com.
