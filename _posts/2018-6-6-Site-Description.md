This site is dedicated to sharing information, tutorials, or whatever comes to mind as something useful for fellow archaeologists. 

Most future posts will be focused on 3D modelling, [R](https://www.r-project.org/), and GIS. 

Feedback is always welcome. Leave a comment on a blog or email me at bischrob@gmail.com.
