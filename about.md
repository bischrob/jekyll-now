### Me

I am an archaeologist focused on the Southwest and Great Basin in the United States. I am currently finishing my master's degree at Brigham Young University and will soon be attending Arizona State University for my doctorate.

### Interests
Survey and excavation are always fun, but when I'm not in the field I most enjoy working with 3D models, GIS analysis, and quantitative methods.
